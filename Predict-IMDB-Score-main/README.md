# Predict-IMDB-Score

IMDb is an online database which stores information about movies and TV shows, and offers a rating scale, 1 to 10, that allows users to rate films. Its rating is one of the most trusted metrics used worldwide to determine the quality and fame of a movie. This website stores tremendous amount of information on a movie, such as duration minutes, director name, actor names, genres, color, content rating, etc. In my project, data are extracted not only from IMDb but also from some external sources, such as Facebook, to make movies rating predictions.
