# Make-Yelp-A-Better-Website

## Business Idea: Introduce a tags & keywords feature into YELP! 

## Pain Points
1. Not everyone will read through entire review 
2. Not every review has meaning content
3. Increase relevance to search ranking
4. New feature to add value for businesses

## Project Scope
1. Use data mining techniques to identify pattern/relationship/correlation within the Yelp dataset 
2. Business-focus: focusing on improving the businesses that have a profile page on Yelp. Example: identify characteristics that are correlated with high/low review volume, identify characteristics that are correlated with high/low star ratings.
3. Review reader-focus: focusing on improving the experience of Yelp users. Example: identify characteristics that are correlated with high/low review helpfulness score, identify the bias in reviews.
